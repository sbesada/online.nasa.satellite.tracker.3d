# nasa.satellite.tracking.3d 
Online 3d web to track nasa satellites and astros

## Web: https://sbesada.github.io/satellites/

## Reference
https://sscweb.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/

## Satellites & Astros Data
This web is populated on various schedules depending on mission, ranging from weekly to yearly and include predictive and definitive orbits

## Accuracy
 - Locations are stored in 32bit floats with a precision of a few meters near the Earth and a few hundred km at Pluto
 - The altitude = (Radial Length (Nasa data) - ERA (EARTH RADIUS FOR NORMALIZATION OF CARTESIAN COORDINATES 6371.2 KM)
 - The longitude and latitude hava small precision error due to the coordinate conversion between NASA coordinate system (GEO) and map coordinate system WGS84 (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84)
